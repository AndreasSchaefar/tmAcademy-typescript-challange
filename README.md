## Overview

### Project Requirements

#### Task 1 - Get posts from remote API, iterate over them, and render them as new DOM nodes

##### Requirements:

- [x] the function should be asynchronous;
- [x] the function should return a response with a known shape (Promise generic);
- [x] use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to get the posts array;

#### Task #2 - Create a function updateObjectInArray.ts - which has to update an object of a given shape in an array of uni-shaped objects and return a cloned array.

##### Requirements:

- [ ] the function has to be called as updateObjectInArray<ObjectShape>(initialArray, key, value, patch);
- [ ] you should create a copy of initialArray before performing the update;
- [ ] the key variable is the key of ObjectShape whose value is known to you (id, for example);
- [ ] the value variable is the value of the key property;
- [ ] the patch variable is the update that needs to be applied (has a Partial<ObjectShape> interface);
- [ ] use async/await to handle asynchronous operations
